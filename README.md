## About

Slooze Challenge provides a platform for developers to work on specific coding tasks, solve problems, and demonstrate their abilities. The challenge may include tasks involving algorithm design, data structure implementation, or building a small application.

## Features

- Well-defined coding challenge
- Clean and modular codebase
- Easy to set up and run
- Open for contributions

## Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/) *(if the project is in Python; update as per your main language)*
- Other dependencies as required (see below)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/swapnilbilgoji/Slooze_Challenge.git

# 2. Navigate into the project directory
cd Slooze_Challenge
```
To execute a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb), follow these step-by-step instructions:

### 1. Install Jupyter Notebook (if not already installed)

You need Python installed. Then, install Jupyter using pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

Or, if you use Anaconda (recommended for data science):

```bash
conda install notebook
```

---

### 2. Open Jupyter Notebook

Navigate to the directory containing your .ipynb file using the terminal/command prompt:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/notebook
```

Then, launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser.

---

### 3. Open Your .ipynb File

- In the browser window that opens, navigate to your .ipynb file and click on it to open.

---

### 4. Execute the Notebook

- You can run individual cells by selecting them and pressing Shift + Enter.
- To run all cells in order:  
  Go to the menu: **Cell** > **Run All**

---

### 5. Save Your Work

- Save your notebook as you go by clicking the save icon or pressing Ctrl + S.

---

### 6. (Optional) Export your Notebook

- You can export your notebook as a PDF or HTML via:  
  **File** > **Download as** > choose your format.

---

#### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter kernel errors, ensure your Python environment has all required packages installed (you can install packages using pip or conda).
- If you get "command not found" for jupyter, ensure your Python/Scripts folder is in your PATH.

*Happy coding!*
